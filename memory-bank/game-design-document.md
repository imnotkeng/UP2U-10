# Game Design Document — Neon Spill

## Core Feeling
- **Satisfying progression**: Watching territory expand with each color choice
- **Simple input, deep outcome**: One click causes cascading visual changes
- **Tactile response**: Colors snap and flood across the board with animation
- **Flow state**: Easy to understand, challenging to master

## Game Fantasy
You are a color conductor, orchestrating a neon symphony across the grid. With each strategic color choice, you watch your domain grow, ripple by ripple, until you've unified the entire board under your command. Limited moves force precision—every choice matters.

## Target Players
- **Casual puzzle fans**: Players seeking quick, satisfying gameplay sessions (2-5 minutes)
- **Visual learners**: Players who enjoy immediate, colorful feedback
- **High-score seekers**: Players motivated by optimizing move counts

## Player Experience
1. **First impression**: Bright, glowing neon colors on dark background
2. **Learning moment**: Click a color, watch the flood expand from the corner
3. **Aha moment**: Realizing that strategic planning reduces move count
4. **Engagement loop**: Choose color → Watch expansion → Count decreases → Win or retry
5. **Endgame**: Satisfying full-board fill or "just one more move" motivation to retry

## Project Goals
Create a complete, playable Flood Fill game that:
- Generates a grid of random neon colors
- Allows player control of the top-left tile
- Expands territory when adjacent colors match
- Limits moves to add strategic challenge
- Provides visual feedback through animations
- Supports instant replay/restart
- Is fully functional with clear, commented code

## Success Criteria
- Game is winnable with optimal play
- Visual feedback makes moves feel impactful
- Move limit creates genuine challenge without frustration
- Restart flow encourages replayability
- Code is readable and well-commented

## Visual Style
- **Palette**: Neon colors (hot pink, cyan, lime green, electric purple, bright yellow, orange)
- **Background**: Dark (black or deep navy) for neon contrast
- **Animations**: Smooth color transitions, ripple effects
- **UI**: Minimal, non-intrusive—game is the focus
