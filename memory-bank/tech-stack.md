# Tech Stack — Neon Spill

## Language
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Vanilla)**
  - No framework dependencies
  - Runs directly in any modern browser
  - Easy to read, modify, and debug
  - Aligns with "vibe coding" philosophy—simple, direct

## Libraries / Frameworks
- **None planned**
  - Keep it lightweight and self-contained
  - Avoid build steps or complex tooling
  - Focus on game mechanics, not infrastructure

## Tools
- **Browser Developer Tools**: For debugging and testing
- **Modern web browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for gameplay

## Platform Target
- **Web browser**: Desktop and mobile responsive
- **Single HTML file**: Self-contained game (CSS and JS embedded)
- **No backend required**: Fully client-side logic

## Reasons for Choices
1. **Simplicity**: Vanilla JS is sufficient for the game logic
2. **Accessibility**: No installation, build process, or dependencies
3. **Performance**: Modern browsers handle DOM manipulation and animations efficiently
4. **Learning**: Code is transparent and easy to understand
5. **Vibe coding**: Focus on game feel, not technical complexity
6. **Rapid iteration**: Change and refresh—no compilation needed

## Future Considerations
If the project grows, potential additions:
- Canvas or WebGL for more advanced animations
- Local storage for high scores
- Sound effects (optional, Web Audio API)
- Touch gesture support for mobile
